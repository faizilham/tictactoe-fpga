A 1-Player Tic-Tac-Toe on FPGA. It's a VHDL project on Altera Quartus II I've done ages ago during my undergraduate years.
I'm not sure what brand and spec of the FPGA I used back then, but I believe it was Altera Cyclone II.

I *think* it's still working, but I haven't test it again. At least I still have the code and the video demo lol.
I just want to have a back up on my github in case I want to revisit FPGA programming in the future.
